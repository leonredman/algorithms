Hash Tables

There are built in Hash Tables in Javascript  and they are known as objects
We are going to implement out own

we can do an example where we build an array with address space
We can build an inventory for a hardware store for example

We use key value pairs and run them thru the hash
{nails: 1000}

It is only the key (nails) that is run thru the hash
all letters have an ASCI numerical value - these are run thru a math equation and we are given a number
Example we are given 2 - that is where we put the object in the table in memory

The hash function  - basically does a calculation and  outputs the result in memory to an address (example 2)

CHARACTERISTICS OF A HASH  

This is a one way.   If you take nails and run it through the hash and it gives youjb   a value of 2
YOU Cannot take 2 and run it through the hash and have it give you Nails.  It wont do this.

Hashes are also DETERMINISTIC - meaning it will always produce he same number, so every time you run nails 
through the hash generator it will give you the value 2

set(key, value)

Another example if we run set with a key and value - set('nails, 1000)  this will give us an array ['nails, 1000]
it will also give us an address based on the calculation it does on the string nails and we get the value 2, so we put it in that address

COLLISIONS

If we run our hash over a few values and place them in our generated locations we see that we can end up
with a COLLISION, where 2 different key value pairs may end up in the same location with value of 2.  We dont 
overwrite them in that location, they are able to all go in that location. Its an Array with arrays inside.
