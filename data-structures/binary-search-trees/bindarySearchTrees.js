// BINARY SEARCH TREES   (see images)

// if we have a tree with one node at the top with a value of 47

// and we add another node to the tree with value of 76
// if greater than 47 goes right, if less than it goes left
// so 76 goes right

// if we add another node with value of 52 we also compare it against the top
// its greater than 47 so it goes right ,but there is another item so
// we have another node with value of 76 and we have to compare to it also
// we find that 52 is less than 76 so this goes 'left'

// we add another node of 21
// we compare it to the top and see that 21 is less tan 47 so it goes left

// we add another node of 82
// we compare it to the top is greater than 47 so we go right
// we compare it to 76 node  and its greater so  we go right
// the spot is open so we place it

// we add another node of 18
// we compare to 47 and its less than so we go left
// we compare it to 21 and its less than so we go left
// that spot is open so we place it

// we add a node of 27 and compare it to the top value 47, its less than so we go left
// we compare it to the node 21 and its greater than so we go right
// that spot is open so we place it.

// NOTE
// ALL THE ITEMS TO THE LEFT ARE LESS THAN 47
// ALL THE ITEMS TO THE RIGHT ARE GREATER THAN 47

// ON THE LEFT ALL THE ITEMS ON THE LEFT OF 21 WILL BE LESS THAN IT
// AND ALL THE ITEMS ON THE RIGHT WILL BE GREATER THAN 21 NO MATTER HOW BIG THE TREE GETS
