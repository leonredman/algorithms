GRAPHS

TERMINOLOGY:

An element in a graph is Called a Vertex (sometimes is is called a node, but proper name is Vertex)

If we have 2 elements and a line between them this is called an Edge (proper term) or Connection

If we have 3 Vertex (elements), then you can have connections between each  or all the Vertex in the graph (image examples Vertex1,2,3)
There is no limitation to how many verticies can connect too or have edges with.

What are they used for?
They are good for Maps Apps like a GPS on your phone.

We can weight the Edges on the graph 
The edge weights help determine the least cost path. So if one edge is weighted 15 and the other 2 are weighted
3 and 2 then they are the least cost path even though there are 2 edges vs the 1.  THere are 2 fast links vs one Slow one.

There are another feature of graphs.
Say we are building facebook and we have 2 accounts. You and a friend. Both are linked. Bi directional relationship (edges)
If there are not arrows show on the Edges it is considered  bidirectional by default

On the platform say you follow someone but they dont follow you back that is a one way directional. These have arrows pointing one way only.
This is a one way relationship.

A Binary Tree is a type or graph with limitations they can only point to 2 other items and each of the connections are directional
Linked List is also type of tree, so this is also a type of a graph that can be one directional, or doubly linked list which is bi directional.

When we think of graphs though we generally think of typical graphs(see image)
