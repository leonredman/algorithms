BIG O of Graphs

SPACE COMPLEXITY:

In an Adjacency Matrix vs a List, we see that the Adjacency 
list stores the Vertex and the edges (as an object). 
In the Adjacency Matrix we have to store the edges (B and E) 
as they are pointed to with 1's. But we have to store all 
the zeros also. This makes the matrix very in-efficient for space COMPLEXITY

The matrix is the number of verticies squared
O(|V|squared)

The List is the Number of Verticies plus the Number of edges
O(|V|+|E|)

ADD A VERTEX:
If we add a vertex F

TO ADD IN A ADJACENCY LIST:
Very easy to add, we just slide in another vertex at the end of the list F:[]

TO ADD IN A ADJACENCY MATRIX:
We must change the matrix to look different with another horizontal and verticle column
This is equivilant to creating a new Matrix, so the time complexity is the number of Verticies 
Squared for the Matrix but O(1) for the list

TO CREATE AN EDGE BETWEEN B AND F:
