Adjacency List

Instead of a Matrix, we can also express the graph as a list. For this we can simply store as an object

So an Adjacenty List is simply expressed it as an object
The element A is the key, and the edges that it points to are an array of "B" and "E"

 {
  A:["B", "E"]
}

A is the key
and the edges we are connecting to are E and B

Our Full graph looks like this as an object

{
  A:["B", "E"],
  B:["A", "C"],
  C:["B", "D"],
  D:["C", "E"],
  E:["A", "D"],
  }
