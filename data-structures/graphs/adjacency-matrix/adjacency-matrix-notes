There a couple of ways we can store a graph
1. adjacency matrix
2. adjacency list.

ADJACENCY MATRIX:

say we have a graph with 5 elements and they are named a,b,c,d,e 
The adjacency matrix would look like a table with the elements in a row at the top and side.
We start with A  at the top and it points to E and B, so in the matrix we would put a 1 for each of those {see image 1}
We put Zeros in the spots that A does not point to (A,C and D)

Then we Have element B and it points to elements A and C.
 This is how we build out an adjaceny matrix

 The axis of the adjacency matrix verticle column on the left is the vertex
 The horizontal column in the matrix is what the vertex points to or not

 A cannot point to A 
 B cannot point to B 
 and so on so we get a 45 degree line where they are always zeros
 If the graph has all bi-directional connections the matrix is going to be symetrical across the 45 degree line and 
 will be a mirror image

 If one of the elements is one directional the matrix is no longer symetrical

 If the graph is weighted we can change the matrix so instead of using all 'ones' we can store the weights in the matrix
