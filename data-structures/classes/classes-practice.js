// A class is like a cookie cutter
// create a class and give it a name "Cookie" for example
{
  // Classes always have something called a constructor. Its what creates the new cookies from the class. We pass in a (value)
  //create a constructor and pass in a value like 'color' for example
  {
    // we use this keyword and pass the value to the actual new cookies we are creating
  }
} //  this is now a valid class

// now we can create new cookies

// we declare a variable example (variableOne)
// we use the 'new' keyword to create an instance of a  "new" class. "new calls the constructor"
//variableOne is the specific instance of the class 'Name' that we are creating using the new keyword
// we pass it the value. That creates a value for the  class Name. ==> 'this' class Name is "Value of whatever you passed".

//create instance one

//create instance two

// nameTwo is a specific instance of Name, 'this' name is 'your value'

// GETTER AND SETTER
// 2 broad categories of methods  to 'get a value' and 'set a value'
// create 2 functions that get this value and return this value, and that set this value
{
}
{
}

// write out our complete Class code put together with out constructor and getter and setter

//if we run our code we can get color and set color
