Recursion

This is used alot in algorithms
Recursion is a function that calls itself..... until it doesn't.

Example is a Gift box and we need to open it.
We would use the openGiftBox() method.
The yeild would either be a ball inside the box, or  another gift box inside the previous gift box.
We would then have to open the second gift box with the openGiftBox() method also.
We would then get an orange ball, or... we would get an even small gift box.
We then run the method again and finally get the orange ball.
