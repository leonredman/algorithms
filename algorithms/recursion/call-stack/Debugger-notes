// NOTES ON USING DEBUGGER TO STEP THRU CODE

// in chrome dev tools if we click on the show debugger tool in the upper right, it opens  the tools
// the tools we care about are teh section "Call Stack"  and the Section "Breakpoints"

// in the code section if we click on a line number it highlights the number.
// this highlight creates a breakpoint and we can see it in the breakpoints section
// If we click on the triangle icon towards the bottom to run snippet in console
// We see the pause on the breakpoint and highlight on the code
// This allows us to walk thru the code one step at a time and see the code run, instead of all at once
// At the top right we see the "arrow with a dot" button that allows us to step thru the code
// When we click it steps thru the code and in our example it add the function to the call stack
// When we step to the console logs, it executes the code, and steps to the curly brace, which ends the code
// The curly brace step runs and ends that function and removes it from the callStack
