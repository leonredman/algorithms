FACTORIAL NOTES

Fctorial is used as an example of how to use recursion

What is Factorial?

This is factorial:

 4!  ( four factorial)

 it is  4 * 3 * 2 * 1 

 The last 3 numbers 3 * 2 * 1 = 3!  or 3 factorial

 so we could say that is is 4 * 3!

 we can keep breaking this down to the final base case 
 4!
 4 * 3!
     3 * 2!
          2 * 1!
              1  (Base Case)  (gets smaller and smaller, same as getting to ball in recursion box example)

CODE EXAMPLE 

function factorial(n) {   // n would be 4
  if(n === 1) return 1    // if we ever get to point where n equal one we return 1
  return n * factorial(n-1)  // otherwise we return n times 
}

this breaks down to 

factorial(4)
return 4 * factorial(3)
return 3 * factorial(2)
return 2 * factorial(1)
return 1                 // if statement show we have one in their so we return one

we can then do the math... The one is being returned is the one in the return 2 * factorial(1) statement
so we can calculate 2 * 1 which returns 2. Which moves up and we calculate 3 time 2 and we return 6 etc.

Code walk thru

factorial(4) = 24

return 4 * 6 = 24 

return 3 * 2 = 6 (6 moves up)

return 2 * 1 = 2 (2 moves up)
