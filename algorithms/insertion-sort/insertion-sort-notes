INSERTION SORT

This method always starts with the second item
We then compare it to item before it
If it is less than the item before it, we switch them
Then we move to the next item.
If the item is not less than the item before it, then it stays put
We then move to the next item

We compare that item to the item before it and if its less than we then move it over
We then also compare it to the next new item before it after it moved and if its less than we move over it again
Once we find the item before is not less than we insert it back into the array
