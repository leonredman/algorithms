// Big O of insertion sort

// It has a for loop inside of a for loop which means its O(n^2)

// If something else is almost sorted

[1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6];

// In this example array, we iterate thru and see that
// only 3 needs to be moved since it is less than
// we basically made 1 pass. This would be n complexity not n^2

// In some situations we can use other more primitive algorithms
// like Insertion sort  but have it run faster

// Bubble, Selection and insertion sort all have O(n^2) time complexity
// Bubble, Selection and Insertion Sort all have O(1) space complexity
// All three sort the array in place, that means you do not
// create additional copies of the array

// Bubble, Selection and insertion sort are all O(n) if you start with a sorted or almost
// sorted array - False

// Only Insertion Sort is O(n) when you start with a sorted or almost sorted data
