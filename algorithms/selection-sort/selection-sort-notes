SELECTION SORT

We start with an array.
Selection sort is similar to bubble sort except "we keep track of the indexs"
So our array [4,2,6,5,1,3]  has indexes 0 - 5

We start with the first item and we assign a variable called 'min' and we set min to the first index in the array. "min = 0"
This is the first index
we then compare this item to everything else in the array
The element '2' is smaller than element '4' so we store the index of 1 as min
We move down the line comparing until we find that element 2 is greater than element 1 so we store Min as index 4
until we get to the end of the array.  Once we have completed our first pass
we then switch the two items at the indexes. So for this example we switch the values of 4 at index 0 with value of 1 at index of 4

[1,2,6,5,4,3]  is now our array after the first pass.(4 and 1 have changed positions)

We then start with the next item in the array which is the value of 2 at the index of 1. So min is set to 1  "min = 1"
We then compare it to everything else.
This item of 2 is in the right position so it does not move in this example - we color it green in image to show complete.

The third item in the array has a value of 6 and index of 2
we set min = 2
We compare  each element and replace the min with the index of lowest value. We see that index of 5 had lowest value of 3
We switch the values at the index of 2 and index 5 so the new array is 
[1,2,3,5,4,6]

We iterate thru again and compare the value of 5  which is a min of 3 and value of 4 with index of 4
We see that the value of 4 is lower than 5 so we switch those 
arry is now [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Then we compare the last 2 items which are values of 5 and 6, these are in the correct order so dont need to move
