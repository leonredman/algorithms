BUBBLE SORT ALGORITHM

The easiest algorithm to start with

Say we have an array [4,2,6,5,1,3]

How it works?

We compare the first item (4) with the second item (2)
If the first item is bigger than the second Item we switch them so now its (2) then (4)
then
we compare the second item with the third item  (4) and (6) - its not bigger so we leave them.
then
we Compare the third item to the fourth item (6) and (5) and if its bigger we switch then.
We go down the line doing this until we get to the last item.

Whatever the largest item is that is bubbled all the way up to the top
It took 5 steps to get that to the end in a 6 item array.

We then go through with each item until they are all bubbled up.
The comparisions get smaller and smaller each time.
